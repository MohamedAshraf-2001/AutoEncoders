# AutoEncoders
Autoencoders are a type of neural network commonly used in unsupervised deep learning tasks. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, 
which work together to learn a compressed representation of the input data. The encoder takes in raw data, such as images or text, 
and learns to transform it into a lower-dimensional representation, called the "latent space." The decoder then takes the latent space representation 
and tries to reconstruct the original input data as accurately as possible. During training, the model tries to minimize 
the difference between the original input and the reconstructed output.
Autoencoders have several applications in deep learning, including:

1) Data compression: Autoencoders can be used to compress large amounts of data into a smaller representation, which can then be stored or transmitted more efficiently.

2) Feature extraction: Autoencoders can be used to learn a set of features that are useful for a specific task, such as image classification or natural language processing.

3) Anomaly detection: Autoencoders can be used to identify unusual or anomalous data points by measuring the difference between the original input and the reconstructed output.

4) Denoising: Autoencoders can be used to remove noise or other unwanted features from data, by training the model to reconstruct the original input from a noisy or distorted version.

Overall, autoencoders are a powerful tool in deep learning that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from data compression to anomaly detection and beyond.
